# Introduction
Hello, guys. This is a '*little*' project I have been doing for the UC Santa Cruz Bayesian Statistic course. I actually fulfilled the requirements of the course in my EDA, so I just want to submit the project for the credit on a course I completed well over two months ago. However, I am still finishing up the last part of the model, constructing and running the negative binomial (currently investigating some data processing issues which are occuring on the current iteration) with the EDA columns based columns. It ultimately is an extremely simple model, and we will shall see how well it performs, but this has been a great practice of the different issues, considerations, and computational cost of running Bayesian models. I can definitely see how creating 'parallelizable' MCMC functions able to be used on distributed computing would be essential to running models which could give a more reasonable training time due to the overall long and iterative process.

I would also call this 'data science report' more adjacent to the Coursera lab structures. This would not be a sufficient investigation into this area for a production model, but since this is a project for an online course that I completed two months ago and has taken many-many-many hours to complete, I must ask thee shall forgive me. Cheers, hope something in there makes you laugh!
